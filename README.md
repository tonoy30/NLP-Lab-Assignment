# Natural language processing - Lab-Assignment

## Tasks :
1. Accomplish your assigned task on dataset. This is your bilingual corpus or parallel corpus.


2. Develop a python program to split sentences in a Bangla dataset. Save the program as nlp_sent_\<roll>.py. Write some key observations in nlp_sent_\<roll>.pdf 
 

3. Develop a python program to tokenize a Bangla dataset. Save the program as nlp_tokenizer_\<roll>.py. Write some key observations in nlp_tokenizer_\<roll>.pdf


4. Develop a python program to accomplish the following tasks: (Save the program as nlp_histogram_\<roll>.py.). We will provide access to your parallel dataset when you finish so that you can perform following tasks.
   
* Extract following statistics from your parallel corpus:

|                                              | English side | Bangla side |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Corpus size (in words) excluding punctuation |              |             |
| Corpus size (in chars) excluding spaces      |              |             |
| Average sentence length (in words)           |              |             |
| Vocabulary size (no. of unique words)        |              |             |
| Lexical diversity*                           |              |             |
| Corpus size (in lines)                       |              |             |

   *How frequently on average each vocabulary item appears in the corpus.
   
* Top ten frequent words in your parallel corpus:

|       | English side |     |       | Bangla side |     |
|-------|--------------|-----|-------|-------------|-----|
| Words | Frequency    | (%) | Words | Frequency   | (%) |
|       |              |     |       |             |     |

* Draw some contrastive pictures between two languages from the statistics you observed and write in nlp_histogram_\<roll>.pdf
